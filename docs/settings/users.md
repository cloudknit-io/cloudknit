# Users

If you have admin permissions to your organization in CloudKnit, you can manage other Users using Settings --> Users page. 

## Invite another user

If you want to invite another user to your organization you can do that entering details as seen in the screenshot below and hitting `Create` button. After the user has been added, they can go to https://cloudknit.app and login with their Github creds.

We currently have 2 user levels: 
* Admin - They can perform all operations in their org
* User - They cannot change any Settings but can do any other operation in their org

## Remove existing user

To remove an existing user from the org, find them in the list of Existing Users and hit the Delete icon and hit confirm. User won't be able to login to CloudKnit after they are removed. 

Note: If you remove a user by mistake you can always add them back.
