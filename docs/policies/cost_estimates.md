Costs are **monthly estimates** calculated at the time of last reconciliation. Estimated costs are calculated on the basis of resources that a component uses.

**{{ company_name }}** uses **infracost** to calculate the component cost. You can find list of supported resources by Infracost [here](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/aws/).

Estimated costs for an Environment is based on the sum of estimates for all components. Similarly, estimated monthly costs of all environments for team is based on the sum of cost estimates for all environments.
