zLifecycle is a Continuous Delivery platform for managing Environments across various cloud providers and on-premises.

It enables organizations to Define, Provision, Detect Drift + Reconcile, and Teardown environments. It also provides dashboards and reports for data-driven decision making.

## Why zLifecycle?

Environment definitions and configurations should be declarative and version controlled. Environment deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.
