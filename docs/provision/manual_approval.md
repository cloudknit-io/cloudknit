# How to Approve?

In this sample example we are **provisioning** an environment called **sandbox**.

Once your YAML is pushed, you will see a similar card on **zlifecycle Environments** page.

<br/>

![sample-dashboard](../assets/images/sample-dashboard.png "Sample Dashboard")

<br/>

* Click the required environment to navigate to the **DAG View**.

<br/>

![sample-dag-view](../assets/images/sample-dag-view.png "Sample DAG View")

* As shown in the above image, with **autoApprove** as `false` once our environments plan completes our component now **waits for approval for provisioning**. Once at this page **click** on the component which you want to **approve**.

<br/>

![sample-right-panel](../assets/images/sample-right-panel.png "Sample Right Panel")

<br/>

* Once clicked, you will see a right panel (which is a **component details view**) as shown in the above image. Now you can click on the **approve button** and then on the **confirm button** to continue with the provisioning of your environment.
