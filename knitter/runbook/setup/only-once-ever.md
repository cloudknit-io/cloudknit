# Only Once Ever

These steps need to be done only once ever.

### Setup by CompuZest

#### Install Internal Github App (Only to be done once)

We need to install Internal zLifecycle Github App to couple of repositories so that zLifecycle can read/write to those repositories and create webhooks

- Go to [Internal zLifecycle Github App](https://github.com/organizations/zLifecycle/settings/apps/internal-zlifecycle/installations)
- Install App to CompuZest Org & give access to `helm-charts` & `terraform-modules` repos
- Install App to `zLifecycle-il` Org and give access to `All repositories`
